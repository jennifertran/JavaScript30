  <p>The goal behind this project is to understand the difference between references vs copying.</p>
  <p>Please view the console using inspect and refresh for results</p>

  <p>If you are not able to view it on console, this is what it looks like: </p>

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    console.log("Note: Q1 only applies to strings, numbers and booleans");
    console.log("\n");
    console.log("Q1: Given that age = 100, age2 = age")

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;

    age = 200;
    console.log("Age is " + age);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const players2 = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    console.log("Q2: Given the following array called players");

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players2;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // team references back to the players array which has changed

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log("If team = players, and team[3] = Lux, what is the output of players?");

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players2);

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    console.log("\n");
    console.log("Explanation: It's because it is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array.");

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead using slice!
    console.log("Solution: How do we fix this? We can take a copy of it instead using either slice, concat, or the new ES6 Spread.");

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // Spread takes every item and puts it into the containing array
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // If we were update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Jennifer Tran',
      age: 20
    };

    console.log(person);

    // and think we make a copy:
    //const captain = person; // Cannot do this because if we were to change something, it will just concatenate to the person object. Ex:
    //captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead? We use object.assign
    console.log("\n");
    console.log("How do we make a copy?");
    console.log("We use something called Object.Assign where the parameters contains a blank object, the object you want to copy, and new properties");
    // Params: a blank object, object you want to copy, and new properties
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(capt2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    console.log("How would you make a deep copy of this object?");
    console.log("Since using Object.Assign would only copy 1 level deep of the object, you could use lodash or use JSON.parsing to make the copy.");
